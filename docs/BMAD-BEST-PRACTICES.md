# BMAD Method Best Practices for webinde

## Introduction

This guide provides best practices for using the BMAD Method effectively within the webinde project. These practices are based on BMAD's official recommendations, adapted specifically for our documentation-focused Astro project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Use Fresh Chats for Workflows
**Why**: Context accumulation leads to hallucinations and degraded responses.

**Practice**:
- Start a new chat for each workflow
- Don't reuse chats across multiple workflows
- Keep workflow conversations focused on single objectives

**Example**:
```
❌ Bad: Run PRD workflow, then tech-spec, then architecture in same chat
✅ Good: New chat for PRD → Close → New chat for tech-spec → Close → New chat for architecture
```

### 2. Let Agents Guide You
**Why**: Agents know their workflows better than we do.

**Practice**:
- Always check `workflow-status` when unsure
- Trust agent recommendations for next steps
- Follow the suggested workflow order
- Don't skip required workflows

**Example**:
```
Developer: "I need to add a feature"
✅ First: Load Analyst → Run workflow-status
✅ Then: Follow the recommended workflow path
❌ Don't: Jump straight to coding
```

### 3. Choose the Right Track
**Why**: Overhead should match complexity.

**Practice**:
- Use Quick Flow for simple tasks (< 15 stories)
- Use BMad Method for complex features (10-50 stories)
- Use Enterprise Method for governance needs (30+ stories)
- When in doubt, run `workflow-init` and let it recommend

**webinde-specific guidelines**:
- Content updates → Quick Flow
- New sections/categories → BMad Method
- Theme overhaul → BMad Method or Enterprise

### 4. Document Everything
**Why**: BMAD is document-driven; future you will thank present you.

**Practice**:
- Save all workflow outputs (PRDs, specs, architecture docs)
- Store in `/docs` directory with clear naming
- Cross-reference related documents
- Keep docs updated as project evolves

**Naming convention**:
```
docs/
├── planning/
│   ├── PRD-[feature-name].md
│   └── tech-spec-[feature-name].md
├── architecture/
│   ├── architecture-[feature-name].md
│   └── ux-design-[feature-name].md
└── implementation/
    └── implementation-notes-[feature-name].md
```

## Agent-Specific Best Practices

### Analyst (AN)
**Best for**: Initial exploration, research, problem definition

**Best practices**:
- Use for brainstorming new content categories
- Great for competitive analysis (other documentation sites)
- Can help define product vision for major updates
- Use `workflow-init` to start any new initiative

**webinde use cases**:
- "Should we add a new content category?"
- "What content gaps do we have?"
- "How does our SEO documentation compare to competitors?"

### Product Manager (PM)
**Best for**: Requirements, prioritization, roadmap

## Workflow Best Practices

### Starting a New Feature

**Step-by-step**:
1. **Analyze** (if complex or unclear):
   ```
   Load Analyst
   Run: workflow-init OR brainstorm-project
   Output: Understanding of problem space
   ```

2. **Plan**:
   ```
   Load PM
   Run: prd (for BMad Method) OR tech-spec (for Quick Flow)
   Output: Requirements document
   ```

3. **Design** (if needed):
   ```
   Load Architect
   Run: create-architecture
   Output: Architecture document
   
   Load UX Designer (if UI work)
   Run: create-ux-design
   Output: UX design document
   ```

4. **Break Down**:
   ```
   Load Scrum Master
   Run: breakdown-stories
   Output: Story list with estimates
   ```

5. **Implement**:
   ```
   For each story:
     Load Developer
     Run: implement-story
     Load Test Architect (if needed)
     Run: create-tests
   ```

6. **Document**:
   ```
   Load Tech Writer
   Run: update-documentation
   Output: Updated docs
   ```

### Updating Existing Documentation

**Quick Flow approach**:
1. **Spec**:
   ```
   Load PM
   Run: tech-spec
   Describe: Content changes needed
   Output: Technical specification
   ```

2. **Implement**:
   ```
   Load Tech Writer OR Developer
   Make changes following spec
   Output: Updated content
   ```

3. **Validate**:
   ```
   Load Test Architect (optional)
   Verify: Links work, formatting correct, frontmatter valid
   Output: Validated content
   ```

### Reorganizing Content Structure

**BMad Method approach**:
1. **Analyze**:
   ```
   Load Analyst
   Run: research
   Analyze: Current structure, pain points, best practices
   Output: Analysis report
   ```

2. **Plan**:
   ```
   Load PM
   Run: prd
   Define: New structure, migration plan, success criteria
   Output: PRD for reorganization
   ```

3. **Design**:
   ```
   Load Architect
   Run: create-architecture
   Design: New directory structure, navigation, cross-references
   Output: Architecture document
   ```

4. **Implement**:
   ```
   Load Scrum Master
   Run: breakdown-stories
   Break into: Manageable migration chunks
   
   For each story:
     Load Developer OR Tech Writer
     Migrate content
     Update links
   ```

5. **Validate**:
   ```
   Load Test Architect
   Verify: All links work, no orphaned content, proper structure
   Output: Validation report
   ```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Skip Planning
**Why it's bad**: Leads to rework, unclear requirements, scope creep
**Instead**: Always create at least a tech-spec, even for small work

### ❌ Don't: Use Same Chat for Everything
**Why it's bad**: Context pollution, hallucinations, poor responses
**Instead**: Fresh chat for each workflow

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Track Recommendations
**Why it's bad**: Either too much overhead or too little planning
**Instead**: Trust workflow-init recommendations or ask BMad Master

### ❌ Don't: Default to Developer for Everything
**Why it's bad**: Miss specialized expertise, poor planning
**Instead**: Use appropriate specialized agent for each phase

### ❌ Don't: Skip Documentation
**Why it's bad**: Future confusion, knowledge loss, onboarding difficulties
**Instead**: Document as you go, use Tech Writer for review

### ❌ Don't: Mix Phases in One Workflow
**Why it's bad**: Unclear deliverables, confused agents
**Instead**: Complete one phase before moving to next

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Workflow Status
**Why it's bad**: Might skip required steps, work out of order
**Instead**: Check workflow-status regularly

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficiency Tips

1. **Use workflow shorthands**:
   ```
   Instead of: "Please run the PRD creation workflow"
   Use: *prd
   ```

2. **Batch similar workflows**:
   - Multiple content updates → Batch in one tech-spec
   - Multiple related stories → Group in one sprint

3. **Reuse templates**:
   - Save successful PRD/spec templates
   - Copy structure for similar features
   - Build library of common scenarios

4. **Set up IDE shortcuts**:
   - Quick agent loading
   - Workflow status check
   - Common workflow commands

### Quality Tips

1. **Review outputs immediately**:
   - Check PRDs for completeness
   - Validate architecture decisions
   - Ensure specs are clear

2. **Get second opinions**:
   - Use different agents for review
   - Party mode for complex decisions
   - Team review for major work

3. **Iterate on specs**:
   - Don't settle for first draft
   - Refine until crystal clear
   - Add examples and edge cases

4. **Track decisions**:
   - Document why, not just what
   - Keep decision log
   - Reference in future work

### Collaboration Tips

1. **Share workflow outputs**:
   - Commit specs to git
   - Share in team channels
   - Review together

2. **Standardize naming**:
   - Consistent file names
   - Clear document titles
   - Logical organization

3. **Cross-reference liberally**:
   - Link related specs
   - Reference architecture docs
   - Connect stories to epics

4. **Communicate phase transitions**:
   - "Moving from Planning to Solutioning"
   - "Ready for Implementation phase"
   - "In review/validation"
